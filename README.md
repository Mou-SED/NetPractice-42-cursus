## What is  an IP address
An IP address is simply an identifier for each device in a network, it is through it that the device can communicate, there are two different types.
- IPv4: Example of IPv4 -> 66.94.29.13
  - has a 32-bit address length.
  - It Supports Manual and DHCP address configuration.
  - In IPv4 end to end, connection integrity is Unachievable.
  - It can generate 4.29×109 address space.
  - The Security feature is dependent on application.
  - Address representation of IPv4 is in decimal.
  - Fragmentation performed by Sender and forwarding routers.
  - In IPv4 Packet flow identification is not available.
  - In IPv4 checksum field is available.
  - It has broadcast Message Transmission Scheme.
  - In IPv4 Encryption and Authentication facility not provided.
  - IPv4 has a header of 20-60 bytes.
  - IPv4 consist of 4 fields which are separated by dot (.) -> (---.---.---.---).
  - IPv4’s  IP addresses are divided into five different classes. Class A , Class B, Class C , Class D , Class E.
  - IPv4 supports VLSM(Variable Length subnet mask).
- IPv6: Example of IPv6 -> 2001:0000:3238:DFE1:0063:0000:0000:FEFB
  - IPv6 has a 128-bit address length.
  - It supports Auto and renumbering address configuration.
  - In IPv6 end to end, connection integrity is Achievable.
  - Address space of IPv6 is quite large it can produce 3.4×1038 address space.
  - IPSEC is an inbuilt security feature in the IPv6 protocol.
  - Address Representation of IPv6 is in hexadecimal.
  - In IPv6 fragmentation performed only by the sender.
  - In IPv6 packet flow identification are Available and uses the flow label field in the header.
  - In IPv6 checksum field is not available.
  - In IPv6 multicast and anycast message transmission scheme is available.
  - In IPv6 Encryption and Authentication are provided.
  - IPv6 has header of 40 bytes fixed.
  - IPv6 consist of 8 fields, which are separated by colon -> (---:---:---:---:---:---:---:---).
  - IPv6 does not have any classes of IP address.
  - IPv6 does not support VLSM.

In our NetPractice project, we will use IPv4.
